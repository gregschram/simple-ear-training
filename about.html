          When my dad got his cochlear implant, I noticed all the practice materials required another person to practice with. Turns out, this is the industry standard: needing two people to coordinate and spend their time.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I looked around for sites and apps that would let him practice on his own, but everything I found was either confusing, meant for children, or just broken. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So I built Ear Practice. Not only is it free, it's designed to be so simple, even those who struggle with computers or apps will find it intuitive. No family tech support required.
        </p>

          All the exercises have been developed with an audiologist, and they feature a variety of voices, because real life isn't just one person talking.

          I hope this is helpful. Hear's to you!
