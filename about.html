          If you're one of the people regaining their hearing, chances are the materials you got to practice require a second person who'll speak and evaluate your response. Being able to practice on your own means more autonomy - and you'll end up practicing more! (Your would-be practice partner will thank you too.)

          When my dad first got his cochlear implant, I was surprised by how lackluster these kind of independent resources were. Confusing layouts, kindergarten themes, or straight-up broken.

          So I made Ear Practice. Not only is it free, it's designed to be so simple, even those who struggle with computers or apps will find it intuitive. No family tech support required.

          All exercises were developed with a licensed audiologist to ensure they actually help. And they feature a variety of voices, better preparing you for the range of pitches and tones found in everyday conversations.

          Ear Practice runs entirely on donations, so chipping in a coffee is always appreciated. But more importantly, spread the word - it's made to be used!
