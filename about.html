          For people regaining their hearing—like cochlear implant recipients or those with hearing aids—most training materials require a second person. This creates a practical problem: when you need someone else to practice, you end up practicing less often.

          The few digital resources I found were either confusing, childish, or abandoned. None solved this fundamental issue.

          So I made Ear Practice. It's free, straightforward, and effective—designed so my father, who's adjusting to a cochlear implant while battling dementia, could practice independently. If it works for him, it can work for anyone.

          All exercises were developed with a licensed audiologist to ensure they actually help. No subscriptions, no complications. Just simple, effective practice you can do on your own, whenever you want.
